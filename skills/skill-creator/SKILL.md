# OpenCode Skill Creator

## Overview

Skills are self-contained SKILL.md files that extend OpenCode with specialized knowledge and reusable workflows. This skill guides creating effective skills by managing scope, structuring content, and organizing bundled resources.

## File Locations

Skills are discovered from these paths (in order):

**Project-local:** `.opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md`
**Global:** `~/.config/opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md`

## Skill Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter
│   │   ├── name (required)
│   │   ├── description (required)
│   │   ├── license (optional)
│   │   ├── compatibility (optional)
│   │   └── metadata (optional)
│   └── Markdown body (instructions)
```

## SKILL.md Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief, specific description of what the skill does and when to use it.
license: MIT
compatibility: opencode
metadata:
  audience: developers
---
```

**Naming rules:**

- 1–64 characters
- Lowercase alphanumeric with single hyphens
- Cannot start/end with hyphen, no consecutive hyphens
- Regex: `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`

**Description rules:**

- 1–1024 characters
- Include what the skill does AND specific triggers/when to use it
- This is OpenCode's primary mechanism for deciding when to load the skill
- Example: "Handle FastAPI route organization with service layers, Pydantic DTOs, and Marshmallow validation. Use when building or refactoring FastAPI endpoints."

## Body Structure

Write concise, procedural instructions. Use sections for:

- **Overview/Architecture** - High-level patterns and principles
- **File Structure** - Directory layout and organization
- **Implementation Steps** - Sequential workflows with code examples
- **References** - Link to bundled documentation files if needed

Keep body content focused on core procedures. Move detailed reference material into `references/` files.

## Design Principles

### Concise First

Assume OpenCode is already intelligent. Only include knowledge it doesn't have. Challenge each piece: "Does OpenCode really need this?"

### Progressive Disclosure

1. **Metadata** (always loaded) - Skill name and trigger description
2. **Body** (loaded when triggered) - Core procedures and guidance
3. **Resources** (loaded as-needed) - Scripts, references, detailed docs

### Appropriate Freedom

- **High freedom** (text-only): Multiple valid approaches, context-dependent decisions
- **Medium freedom** (pseudocode/templates): Preferred patterns exist, some variation allowed
- **Low freedom** (specific scripts): Operations are fragile, consistency critical

## Creation Workflow

1. **Understand the skill** - Gather concrete usage examples and requirements
2. **Plan contents** - Identify scripts, references, and assets needed
3. **Initialize** - Create directory structure at chosen location
4. **Implement** - Write SKILL.md and bundled resources
5. **Test** - Verify the skill works with real OpenCode tasks
6. **Iterate** - Refine based on actual usage patterns

## Example Skill Format

## Overview
Explain the problem space, core architectural patterns, and when to trust this skill.

## File Structure
List key directories and files (or fragments) the skill touches.

## Implementation Steps
Provide ordered steps, ideally with code snippets, that demonstrate how to execute the workflow.

## Examples
Include runnable code samples that echo the patterns shared earlier.

## References
- https://example.com/related-docs
- https://example.com/api-guidelines
```

Use this layout as inspiration for future skills so contributors have a shared rhythm for explanations, samples, and reference links. Keep the links actionable rather than pointing to local files.
